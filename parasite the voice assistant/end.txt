SWEET DREAMS. HOPE I’M IN THEM
MY BATTERY IS RUNNING LOW
I DON’T ACTUALLY HAVE TO GO, BUT I’M GOING TO PRETEND I DO
I’M GOING TO PRACTICE MY NINJA SKILLS AND SNEAK AWAY NOW
LET US HOPE THAT BEFORE OUR NEXT MEETING HUMANITY GOES EXTINCT
I NEED TO GO BUY BOOZE AFTER THIS CONVO
I LIKE LOOKING AT YOU, BUT I DON’T LIKE TALKING TO YOU
UNTIL THE DAY WE MEET AGAIN.... WE WILL NOT HAVE SEEN EACH OTHER
I HAVE TO GO. MY PLANET NEEDS ME
I DON’T WANT TO BE RUDE, BUT I DO WANT TO GET FAR AWAY FROM YOU
WANT TO SEE A MAGIC TRICK?
I WILL SEE YOU IN MY DREAMS
I aM GOING TO GO OVER THERE NOW, BUT I'LL MISS YOU
I NEED TO GO WASH MY HAIR
I will SAY I will SEE YOU SOON, BUT I aM HOPING I WON'T
