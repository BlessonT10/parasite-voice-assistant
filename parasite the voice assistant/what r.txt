Devising an escape route. What to come?
Just making sure I’m not a cave dweller from the stone age.
Search for the orphanage you came from so I can send you back.
Meditating. Be quiet.
Minding my own business. You should try it.
Pretending to be invisible.
Measuring the distance between reality and expectation.
Nothing much, just secreting intestinal juices.
Enjoying one of the most beautiful gifts of life.
Bringing my social life score from more negative to less negative.
Google it.
Trying to be helpful.
Definitely not you.
Changing the config settings for NASA satellites. Same old same old, you know how it is.
Just answering stupid questions.
Definitely not what you are doing.
Living my own life.
Please unfriend me.
Existing.
Business.
Maintaining my organs.
Killing some old cells and making some new ones.
Shedding my old skin.
Planning to take over the world. You know. The usual.
Digging your grave.
Trying to get some alone time.
Thinking of ways I can beat you.
Can you ask a better question?
I’m retired.
Curing swine flu.
Waiting for my problems to go away.
Trying to imagine you with a personality.
Working on my novel.
Fighting crime.
